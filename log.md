# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday, April 12, 2020
**Today's Progress**: First day of this (possibly tough) challenge! So as I am learning and practicing Swift for my current job, I decided to take some coding challenges and solve them as first approach. These are taken from codewars.com.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I think a problem might be difficult at first glance, but I need to think about it deeply and realize it is not the end of the world. Just to create a first time solution and then enhace it and see if it works as expected. Sometimes it will be a brute force solution but the main progress is to be able to solve it and avoid giving up. These solutions might not be the best, but once submitted, I can see other solutions and admire how efective (and clever!) they are. That's why I like **codewars**.

### Day 2: Monday, April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was an stressful day. I struggled to solve a kata in codewars.com because instructions were not so clear and the way to solve it in Swift is somewhat complicated because there is no native method or function to accomplish it. So I decided to solve it tomorrow and enhance my solution.

**Thoughts:** I struggled and feel anxious and stressed, but I need to calm down and watch things from another perspective to clarify my thoughts.

### Day 3: Tuesday, April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished yesterday's kata and it was so much clearer for me.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a little bit as I was learning how Swift works with Strings . Arrays and indexes, because it is really different and sometimes make you confuse (or even implement by hand some solutions), specially comming from other programming language practices. In my case, Java. But in the end, I could solve the problem and earn reputation.

Also, I'm intending to create my own personal page, as a Currivulum Vitae and project history for future references.

### Day 4: Wednesday, April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished another kata but this time was in Java.

**Thoughts:** It resulted in a really good excercise and not to complicated. Today I not struggled lol.

### Day 5: Tuesday, April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished some other katas but this time was in Swift.

**Thoughts:** Pending
