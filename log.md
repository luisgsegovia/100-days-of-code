# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday, April 12, 2020
**Today's Progress**: First day of this (possibly tough) challenge! So as I am learning and practicing Swift for my current job, I decided to take some coding challenges and solve them as first approach. These are taken from codewars.com.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I think a problem might be difficult at first glance, but I need to think about it deeply and realize it is not the end of the world. Just to create a first time solution and then enhace it and see if it works as expected. Sometimes it will be a brute force solution but the main progress is to be able to solve it and avoid giving up. These solutions might not be the best, but once submitted, I can see other solutions and admire how efective (and clever!) they are. That's why I like **codewars**.
